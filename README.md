## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal based on NYC August 2019 citibike trip data.

## Results

Male subscribers had the most bike usage, then female subscribers, then unknown gender customers. Male subscribers had the most usage on Thursday and Friday.

The top starting locations for users using their bikes are concentrated in a piece of land stretching 8 miles. There are also varying usages to the east and south of top starting locations. 

![Top Ending Locations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92401000/151679453-4d571899-0d57-4f49-bc67-716e65484762.PNG)

The top ending locations for users using their bikes are concentrated in a piece of land stretching 8 miles. There are also varying usages to the east and south of top ending locations. The ending locations for bike usages mirror starting locations.

## Summary

Based on the results, most users tend to be males using the bikes most on weekdays Monday-Friday between the hours of 6AM-9AM and 4PM-7PM for about 5 minutes. Most bikes users tend to male subscribers with subscribers using more than customers. Also, the bike usages tend to be isolated between an 8 mile stretch with both starting and ending locations being the same. 

Two additional visualizations that can be performed with the given dataset are finding the most bike usage based on age and gender type. The second visualization would be determining the user type by their age so we can target that age group to be subscribers.
